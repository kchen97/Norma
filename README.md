# Norma

This project was realized during 36h at the Stanford Hackathon treehacks, together with Anna Boon, Korman Chen, Miriam Haart, Diya Mathur, Alejandro Salinas, Tim Roesner and Sophia Hu. 
It was selected as one of the Grand Prize finalists and placed in the top 8.

## Inspiration
1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, but 90% who are diagnosed early survive over 5 years. However, breast cancer victims often realize they have breast cancer when it is too late, costing them thousands. About 40% of diagnosed breast cancers are self-detected in its early stages with a routine self-exam, and Norma will help add to that number.

## What it does
Norma is an interactive chat bot aimed at helping to detect breast cancer at an early stage through guidance and education. Norma guides users through a self breast examination, allows users to keep track of their progression with a journal, and provides contact information to a doctor.
